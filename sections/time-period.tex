Calculators have been around since humans had the need to count. The abacus is believed to have been around since 2,400 BCE \cite{abacus}. The rediscovered Antikythera Mechanism is estimated to have been built shortly before the common era \cite{Antikythera}. And before these, people were using their own fingers as calculators. Long story short, there is a vast history of calculators, the technology that built them, and the technology that they built. That is to say the time period is from approximately 2,400 BCE to modern day. Luckily, like most human history, this timeline accelerates as we get closer to present day. The industrial revolution and the invention of modern day computers will be pivotal moments in the history for the humble calculator.
